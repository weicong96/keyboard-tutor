# About
This repository contains source code for a keyboard trainer that I am working on.

From trying to learn typing on a custom keyboard layout, I have found some of my needs lacking on the existing keyboard training programs and this is my attempt to enhance some of the these trainers from my own training

# TODO Feature Checklist
 - SSO for Google for performance tracking
 - Support custom keyboard definitions by importing your own keyboard layout
 - Analysis of most common mistyped characters
